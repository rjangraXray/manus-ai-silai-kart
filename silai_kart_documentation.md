## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend application is built using React.js, a modern JavaScript library that enables the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces. The component-based architecture ensures maintainability and scalability while providing excellent performance across different devices and browsers.

The application follows a modular design pattern with clearly separated components for different functionalities. The main components include the homepage with hero section and category showcase, category pages with product filtering and sorting capabilities, detailed product pages with customization options, and the comprehensive measurement form with step-by-step guidance.

The styling implementation combines modern CSS techniques with traditional Indian design elements, creating a visually appealing interface that reflects the cultural heritage of the products being sold. The color scheme primarily uses deep purples and maroons, colors traditionally associated with royalty and elegance in Indian culture.

### Backend Architecture

The backend is implemented using Flask, a lightweight yet powerful Python web framework that provides flexibility and scalability for web applications. The architecture follows RESTful API principles, ensuring clean separation between the frontend and backend systems.

The database layer utilizes SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite for development and easy deployment, though the architecture supports migration to more robust database systems like PostgreSQL or MySQL for production environments. The database schema includes comprehensive models for customers, products, categories, orders, measurements, and administrative functions.

The API endpoints are organized into logical blueprints including customer management, product catalog, order processing, payment integration, and notification services. This modular approach ensures maintainability and allows for easy extension of functionality.

### Database Design

The database schema is carefully designed to support all aspects of the e-commerce platform while maintaining data integrity and performance. The core entities include customers, products, categories, orders, measurements, and administrative users.

The customer model stores personal information, contact details, and address information, with relationships to orders and measurements for tracking purchase history and saved measurements. The product model includes detailed information about each outfit including descriptions, pricing, available fabrics, colors, and features.

The order management system tracks the complete lifecycle of each purchase from initial creation through payment processing to delivery. The measurement system stores detailed body measurements with the ability to save and reuse measurements for future orders.
